      <h6 class="text-center">2019-2023</h6>
      <p>In my role as a Voluntary Sales assistant for Barnardo's Children Charity, I helped to raise funds for a cause that aligns with my core values. My main tasks were to engage with customers, promote in-store promotions, rotate stock, maintain the shop floor and process transactions. Working in this role allowed me to develop my customer service skills by allowing me to interact with members of my local community. I developed positive relationships with regular customers and contributed to profit goals. I was involved in training other volunteers in the role and found a great passion in mentoring others.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">2017-2023</h6>
        <p>In my time at Bell Baxter High School I achieved SQA qualifications and held many roles. It is during my initial years at school where my passion for science was founded. I became a STEM ambassador and had the opportunity to inspire and engage others in science-based opportunities. I also attended the Scottish Space School in partnership with the University of Strathclyde. This opportunity allowed me to partake in an enterprise challenge and to further develop my leadership skills. I attended lectures from NASA scientists and was thoroughly inspired. In High School I also had the roles of Prefect and Wellbeing Ambassador. I took part in training from CAHMS and used it to promote positive wellbeing among my student body. I also supported staff to run school events and enjoyed being a team player. Being at high school also allowed me to pursue my favourite hobby, music. I was an active member in the Fife Youth Orchestra and performed at school events. I'm very grateful for all of the opportunities presented to me at this point in my life.</p><br>

My classes have allowed me to further develop my knowledge in the fields of Medical Science, Chemistry, Physics and Web Development. I have completed thrilling lab practicals in the new state-of-the-art Science Teaching Hub. I pride myself in always handing in assignments on time and often challenge myself to consistently produce my best work.</p>
