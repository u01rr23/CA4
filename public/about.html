    <p class="text-left aboutMe">I am a dedicated student who is enthusiastic about learning new skills. I pride myself in having a can-do attitude and will always push myself to produce my best work. I consistently meet deadlines and always manage my time well.</p>
    <p class="text-left aboutMe">My current qualifications consist of Advanced Highers in Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics. I also have additional Highers in English, Music, Graphic Communication and Human Biology, and a National 5 qualification in Spanish. I put in a lot of effort into getting these qualifications and built up a very strong revision ethic. This has prepared me to be able to learn and retain information easily.</p>
    <p class="text-left aboutMe">In my spare time I enjoy reading and baking. Reading allows me to explore different viewpoints of the world and immerse myself in different experiences. Baking is a hobby that I have recently picked up in an attempt to build my confidence in following a set of instructions. This has really helped me increase my accuracy in my lab practicals.</p>
