A personal and professional portfolio with a chat function
# Objectives
A portfolio should convey information that may attract potential employers in a professional format. It should have all of the relevant information potential employers should require to consider the person as a candidate. This also must be carried out in an accessible way with easy navigation and a layout that is easy to interpret. 
# Target Audience
The target audience of my website is potential employers. My portfolio is not gender or age specific. It's simple design means it is accessible and aimed for all employers. Employers are usually looking for someone formal, so I made sure that my design was professional.
# The Design Process
My website consists of HTML, CSS and Javascript components. My understanding of Javascript is very limited and I believe this is unfortunately reflected in the final product. I attempted to research the gaps in my knowledge over the time given and attempted them to the best of my ability.
# Layout
To increase engagement, I went for a different design for each page. I felt this kept my pages from being too boring. Each page has the title 'MyPortfolio' in the top right corner. This contrasts from the navigation being left-aligned on all pages. 
The home page is a list of different paragraphs of my experiences, I believe this provides a unified way for the information to be read. The introduction is centre aligned on this page to differentiate it from my left-aligned paragraphs on my experiences.
The about page has an image on the right hand side in an aside box. This provides a break in the page and draws your attention to the text that is left-aligned beside it. I also added in a link to my CV for potential employers to utilise. It contrasts from the rest of the page as it is in a blue coloured box with a white font colour.
The chat page differs from the others in the way that it has a side navigation. This allows the page to feel less cluttered and has more emphasis is on the messages. As users enter and exit the page, the console logs notifications.
# Colours
I selected a very minimalistic colour scheme to provide the professional feel. Through doing research of professional portfolio websites (Linkedin, Facebook) I found that a simple blue and white colour scheme would be very effective. Using a colour library, I selected #2f6690 as my main colour and #3a7ca5 for any highlighted elements. These colours are over 80% similar to their original colour for all types of colour blindness so I was happy to utilise them in my design.
# Mobile Responsivity
In all of my design choices, I made sure it would create a good layout on all device sizes. Not all employers are likely to have a desktop readily available, so its important that all device sizes get the same user experience.
# Conclusion
The main purpose of my website was to present my personal and professional information in an engaging portfolio with a chat function. With a focus on accessibility, I believe I have produced a formal portfolio with an exciting layout. To further improve this in the future, I would improve my knowledge of Javascript and create real time notifications visible outwith the console.
